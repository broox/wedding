# Brooks Wedding

This is the website that I made in 2005 for our wedding...
before smart phones or sites like The Knot existed.

I recently used AI to modernize the old markup, made it more mobile friendly, and relaunched it for fun for our 20th anniversary.

The design and content remain the same as the original.
