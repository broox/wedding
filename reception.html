                        Since Kari and I couldn't decide on a meal, we each picked an entree; you'll be served three pepper crusted pork tenderloin with kaluha and shallot cream along with pecan encrusted chicken with Maytag bourbon onion sauce.  This will also include:

                        <ul>
                            <li> Iowa Butternut Bisque cooked with tomatoes, creamed with celery, onion, and garlic topped with sour cream and sauteed leeks
                            <li> Mixed field greens with herbed chevre croutons and a balsamic Vinaigrette
                            <li> Chef's vegetable medley, and red potatoes
                            <li> Dessert will include vanilla bean ice cream and, of course, wedding cake.
                        </ul>

                        Entertainment will be presented by the Freestyle Variety Band.<br/><br/>

                        The easiest way to get to the reception from the church will be via I-235, which is currently being completely re-routed.  Thus we've given a couple options for travel.  The city has put together a construction web site that may help you pick your route: <a href="http://www.i235.com/" target="_blank">www.i235.com</a>.<br/><br/>
